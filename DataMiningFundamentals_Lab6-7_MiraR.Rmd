#The results of these charts show that the overall most important predictors for both models was 'GDP_CAP'. After this, the results differ slightly in order of importance. Specifically, the REGION variable was much more important in the Logistic Regression than in the C&RT.Further, URBAN, LITERACY, and POPULATN had less importance in determinations that I originally predicted for both models.
